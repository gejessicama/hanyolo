For TINAH serial communication to the arduino:

Serial1.print(msg)
	Sends info
Serial1.write(msg)
	Sends a single byte of info
Serial1.available()
	Number of bytes available to read
Serial1.read()
	Reads in info (one byte at a time??)

More info on arduino website https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/
only need to use Serial1 instead of Serial



For the signals currently sent:
's' if there is an object on the right
'S' if there is an object on the left
'c' if there is a cliff on the right
'C' if there is a cliff on the left
